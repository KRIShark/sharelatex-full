## Installation

### Overleaf Toolkit

Use the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) as described in the [Quick-Start Guide](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/blob/master/doc/quick-start-guide.md).
Make sure to set the `OVERLEAF_IMAGE_NAME=tuetenk0pp/sharelatex-full` variable in `config/overleaf.rc`.

Alternatively, you can use a `compose.override.yaml` file as described [here](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#the-docker-composeoverrideyml-file).
Example:

``` yml
services:
    sharelatex:
        image: tuetenk0pp/sharelatex-full
```

### Docker Compose

> [!WARNING]
> This method is not recommended. Use the Overleaf Toolkit instead.

Use the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) provided in the [official GitHub](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf), but change the image to ``tuetenk0pp/sharelatex-full``.
Also, note the additional instructions in the [official Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Release-Notes--4.x.x#manually-setting-up-mongodb-as-a-replica-set).
